## Make sure the necessary packages are installed
	
```{r, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(devtools)

devtools::install_github("afsc-gap-products/GAPsurvey")
# Or
remotes::install_github("afsc-gap-products/GAPsurvey@main")

library(GAPsurvey)
```

or install from local file `.tar.gz`:

```{r install-local, eval = FALSE}
# example, the user may have a different path
install.packages('C:/Users/User/Downloads/GAPsurvey_2025.04.09.tar.gz',
                 repos=NULL, type='source')
library(GAPsurvey)
