# Example Script Using R Package `GAPsurvey`

> Last updated April 2025
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Install R package

Rerun this only when there is a new version of the package to install. The user may install from `GitHub`:

```{r install-github, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("afsc-gap-products/GAPsurvey")
```

or install from local file `.tar.gz`:

```{r install-local, eval = FALSE}
# example, the user may have a different path
install.packages('C:/Users/NOAA/Downloads/GAPsurvey_2025.04.09.tar.gz',
                 repos=NULL, type='source')
```

## Load libraries

```{r load-packages}
library(GAPsurvey)
```

Now we have access to all of the functions in the `GAPSurvey` R package! 

## Open this example `GAPsurvey` script (for reference)

This should already be located on desktop, otherwise find it using the link below. 

```{r find-example-script, eval = FALSE}
system.file("r/GAPsurvey_script.R", package = "GAPsurvey")
```

## What have we historically caught at this station?

Learn more: 

```{r get_catch_haul_history-learn, eval =  FALSE}
?get_catch_haul_history
```

Examples: 

```{r get_catch_haul_history}
## for one year and only 1 station for all species
get_catch_haul_history(
  years = 2021:2023, # optional; if you only want to see a specific year, not the last 10
  species_codes = c(21720, 21740), # optional; pacific cod and walleye pollock ONLY
  survey = "EBS", # for example
  station = "I-13") # for example

## for default 10 years and nearby stations for all species (a typical use-case)
get_catch_haul_history(
     survey = "AI",
     station = "324-73",
     grid_buffer = 3)

```

# All catch data

You can also look through all catch data from the survey

```{r public_data-learn, eval = FALSE}
?GAPsurvey::public_data
```

```{r public_data}
# GAPsurvey::public_data
head(GAPsurvey::public_data) # using `head()` function to see first few (6) rows of dataset 
```

# Species Data

You can also use this to find all species and species codes for quick searching

```{r species_data-learn, eval = FALSE}
?GAPsurvey::species_data
```

```{r species_data}
# GAPsurvey::species_data
head(GAPsurvey::species_data) # using `head()` function to see first few (6) rows of dataset 
```

# Species Polycorder reference

You can also use this to find all species and species codes for quick searching

```{r PolySpecies-learn, eval = FALSE}
?GAPsurvey::PolySpecies
```

```{r PolySpecies}
# GAPsurvey::PolySpecies
head(GAPsurvey::PolySpecies) # using `head()` function to see first few (6) rows of dataset 
```

## What time is sunrise and sunset?

## Convert CTD data to BTD as a backup for SBE39 (aka 'the BT')

This function converts a CTD  hexadecimal (.hex) file to bathythermic data (.btd) and bathythermic header files (.bth). If you are unable to convert your file, please contact sean.rohan@@noaa.gov.

```{r convert_ctd_btd-learn, eval =  FALSE}
?convert_ctd_btd
```

Examples: 

```{r convert_ctd_btd, eval = FALSE}
convert_ctd_btd(
 filepath_hex = system.file(paste0("exdata/convert_ctd_btd/",
   "2021_06_13_0003.hex"), package = "GAPsurvey"),
 filepath_xmlcon = system.file(paste0("exdata/convert_ctd_btd/",
   "19-8102_Deploy2021.xmlcon"), package = "GAPsurvey"),
 latitude = 55,
 VESSEL = 94,
 CRUISE = 202101,
 HAUL = 107, 
 MODEL_NUMBER = 1, 
 VERSION_NUMBER = 1, 
 SERIAL_NUMBER = 8105)
```

# BVDR Conversion to Create BTD data

Converts Marport BVDR data (.ted and .tet files from Marport headrope sensor) to .BTD format.  You must first run the BVDR converter program (convert_bvdr.exe) to convert the Marport .bvdr files into .ted and .tet files that can be pulled into R. The BVDR program and instructions can be found in the RACE Survey App.  You will have to create your own .SGT file using the example in the BVDR instruction file with start and end time (be sure to include a carriage return after your (second and) final row of data!), because this is not a file that our current systems creates.  Once you have used the BVDR converter to output the .ted and .tet files you are ready to use the convert_ted_btd() function here!

This will return .BTH and .BTD files to the path_out directory.

```{r convert_ted_btd-learn, eval = FALSE}
?convert_ted_btd
```

Example: 

```{r convert_ted_btd, eval = FALSE}
 # example input files
 readLines(system.file("exdata/convert_bvdr_btd/201901_94_0003.ted",
   package = "GAPsurvey"))[1:5]

# Recover position data from Globe .log file

In the event that the MARPORT server GPS fails or is incomplete, "convert_log_gps()" converts GLOBE LOG files into a format that can be uploaded into WHEELHOUSE.
To get a .log file that is usable in this function,
1) Go the C:\ globe\ logs\ 2018\ directory and choose GLG file with proper date
2) Use GLOBE Files>Logs> to convert .GLG (binary) to a .LOG (.csv) file
3) convert_log_gps()will prompt you for Vessel code, Cruise no., Haul no. and Date
4) The final prompt will ask for the location of the GLOBE LOG file
5) convert_log_gps()will create csv file in the R directory with filename "new.gps"
6) Rename "new.gps" to HAULXXXX.GPS where XXXX is the haul number
7) Upload HAULXXXX.GPS into WHEELHOUSE
8) NOTE: The raw GLOBE log data are in GMT time (-8 hrs or 4PM AKDT prior day to 4PM current day. Hence if haul with missing GPS spans the 4PM hour (e.g.,3:45-4:30 PM),YOU WILL HAVE TO CONVERT TWO GLG files (current day and next day)and run convert_log_gps()twice & manually combine the two GPS files
9) ALSO NOTE: You may have to shut down GLOBE or wait until after 4pm on following day before all the incoming NMEA data are written to the GLG file.

Now that you have a .log file, you can RUN the function by putting your cursor on the "convert_log_gps()" line below & press CTRL+R.

Returns a .GPS file to the path_out directory with DATE/TIME in AKDT.

```{r convert_log_gps, eval = FALSE}

readLines(system.file("exdata/convert_log_gps/06062017.log",
   package = "GAPsurvey"))[1:5] # input file

# use function

     VESSEL = 94,

# Convert .bvdr files to .marp files

If you mistakenly delete the marport data for a haul, you can retrieve that data through this converter.

Before using this script,
1. Open the .bvdr file in Notepad ++ or a similar text editor.
2. Find the uninterpretable character symbol. Often, depending on the editor, this will look like a box or the highlighted letters "SUB". Find and delete (via replace) these characters for the whole document. An error will appear and only part of the file will be read (stopping at the line before where this unsupported symbol is) if you do not edit the data ahead of time.
3. Save the .bvdr file with these changes and use the link to that file below for path_bvdr
For an example of what a proper .marp file looks like, refer to system.file("exdata/convert_bvdr_marp/HAUL0001.marp", package = "GAPsurvey")

```{r convert_bvdr_marp-learn, eval =  FALSE}

# Example: 

```{r convert_bvdr_marp, eval = FALSE}
# example input file
readLines(system.file("exdata/convert_bvdr_marp/20220811-00Za.bvdr",
  package = "GAPsurvey"))[1:5] # input file

# see what example input file looks like
head(convert_bvdr_marp(
  path_bvdr = system.file("exdata/convert_bvdr_marp/20220811-00Za.bvdr",
                                  package = "GAPsurvey"),
          verbose = TRUE), 20)

# use function
convert_bvdr_marp(
  path_bvdr = system.file("exdata/convert_bvdr_marp/20220811-00Za.bvdr",
                                  package = "GAPsurvey"))
